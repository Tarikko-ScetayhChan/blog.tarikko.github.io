By contrast,<br>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom<br>to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains<br>free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use<br>the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies<br>also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply<br>it to your programs, too.</p><p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p><p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you<br>have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the<br>software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom<br>of others.</p><p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they<br>know their rights.</p><p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p><p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and<br>authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>authors of previous versions.</p><p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>modified versions of the software inside them, although the<br>manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the<br>aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The<br>systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for<br>individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.<br>Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the<br>practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in<br>other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those<br>domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the<br>freedom of users.</p><p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish<br>to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program<br>could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL<br>assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p><p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.</p><h2 id="terms-and-conditions"><a class="anchor" href="#terms-and-conditions">#</a> TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2><h3 id="0-definitions"><a class="anchor" href="#0-definitions">#</a> 0. Definitions.</h3><p>&quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p><p>&quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds<br>of works, such as semiconductor masks.</p><p>&quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>License. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. &quot;Licensees&quot; and<br>&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</p><p>To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of<br>an exact copy. The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of<br>the earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</p><p>A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>on the Program.</p><p>To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,<br>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p><p>To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user<br>through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not<br>conveying.</p><p>An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot; to<br>the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If<br>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p><h3 id="1-source-code"><a class="anchor" href="#1-source-code">#</a> 1. Source Code.</h3><p>The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>making modifications to it. &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source form of<br>a work.</p><p>A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official<br>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>is widely used among developers working in that language.</p><p>The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other<br>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>implementation is available to the public in source code form. A<br>&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component<br>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p><p>The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all<br>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>control those activities. However, it does not include the work's<br>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source<br>includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>subprograms and other parts of the work.</p><p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can<br>regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</p><p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same<br>work.</p><h3 id="2-basic-permissions"><a class="anchor" href="#2-basic-permissions">#</a> 2. Basic Permissions.</h3><p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a<br>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your<br>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p><p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,<br>without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.<br>You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having<br>them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with<br>facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the<br>terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not<br>control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for<br>you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and<br>control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your<br>copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p><p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the<br>conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes<br>it unnecessary.</p><h3 id="3-protecting-users-legal-rights-from-anti-circumvention-law"><a class="anchor" href="#3-protecting-users-legal-rights-from-anti-circumvention-law">#</a> 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h3><p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>measures.</p><p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such<br>circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with<br>respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit<br>operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against<br>the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid<br>circumvention of technological measures.</p><h3 id="4-conveying-verbatim-copies"><a class="anchor" href="#4-conveying-verbatim-copies">#</a> 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h3><p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p><p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p><h3 id="5-conveying-modified-source-versions"><a class="anchor" href="#5-conveying-modified-source-versions">#</a> 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h3><p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these<br>conditions:</p><ul><li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>it, and giving a relevant date.</li><li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>released under this License and any conditions added under<br>section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4<br>to &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.</li><li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This<br>License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no<br>permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li><li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>work need not make them do so.</li></ul><p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work<br>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>parts of the aggregate.</p><h3 id="6-conveying-non-source-forms"><a class="anchor" href="#6-conveying-non-source-forms">#</a> 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h3><p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of<br>sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable<br>Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these<br>ways:</p><ul><li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>customarily used for software interchange.</li><li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding<br>Source from a network server at no charge.</li><li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This<br>alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>with subsection 6b.</li><li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the<br>Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to<br>copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the<br>Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li><li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,<br>provided you inform other peers where the object code and<br>Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general<br>public at no charge under subsection 6d.</li></ul><p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>included in conveying the object code work.</p><p>A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any<br>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,<br>family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for<br>incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a<br>consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of<br>coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,<br>&quot;normally used&quot; refers to a typical or common use of that class of<br>product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way<br>in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected<br>to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of<br>whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or<br>non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant<br>mode of use of the product.</p><p>&quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,<br>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to<br>install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User<br>Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The<br>information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of<br>the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with<br>solely because modification has been made.</p><p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply<br>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>been installed in ROM).</p><p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or<br>updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the<br>recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or<br>installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification<br>itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network<br>or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the<br>network.</p><p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>unpacking, reading or copying.</p><h3 id="7-additional-terms"><a class="anchor" href="#7-additional-terms">#</a> 7. Additional Terms.</h3><p>&quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions<br>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p><p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place<br>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p><p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders<br>of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p><ul><li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li><li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li><li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,<br>or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li><li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors<br>or authors of the material; or</li><li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li><li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions<br>of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,<br>for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly<br>impose on those licensors and authors.</li></ul><p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further<br>restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you<br>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains<br>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p><p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>where to find the applicable terms.</p><p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the<br>above requirements apply either way.</p><h3 id="8-termination"><a class="anchor" href="#8-termination">#</a> 8. Termination.</h3><p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>paragraph of section 11).</p><p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license<br>from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,<br>unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally<br>terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder<br>fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to<br>60 days after the cessation.</p><p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>your receipt of the notice.</p><p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>material under section 10.</p><h3 id="9-acceptance-not-required-for-having-copies"><a class="anchor" href="#9-acceptance-not-required-for-having-copies">#</a> 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h3><p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run<br>a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,<br>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p><h3 id="10-automatic-licensing-of-downstream-recipients"><a class="anchor" href="#10-automatic-licensing-of-downstream-recipients">#</a> 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h3><p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible<br>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p><p>An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an<br>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered<br>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p><p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may<br>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p><h3 id="11-patents"><a class="anchor" href="#11-patents">#</a> 11. Patents.</h3><p>A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The<br>work thus licensed is called the contributor's &quot;contributor version&quot;.</p><p>A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims owned<br>or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For<br>purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant<br>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>this License.</p><p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p><p>In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express<br>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>sue for patent infringement). To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a<br>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>patent against the party.</p><p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>license to downstream recipients. &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have<br>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p><p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>work and works based on it.</p><p>A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within the<br>scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on<br>the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically<br>granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you<br>are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the<br>business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the<br>third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the<br>work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties<br>who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent<br>license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by<br>you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in<br>connection with specific products or compilations that contain the<br>covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent<br>license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p><p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p><h3 id="12-no-surrender-of-others-freedom"><a class="anchor" href="#12-no-surrender-of-others-freedom">#</a> 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h3><p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a<br>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under<br>this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a<br>consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to<br>terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying<br>from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could<br>satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely<br>from conveying the Program.</p><h3 id="13-use-with-the-gnu-affero-general-public-license"><a class="anchor" href="#13-use-with-the-gnu-affero-general-public-license">#</a> 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h3><p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this<br>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>combination as such.</p><h3 id="14-revised-versions-of-this-license"><a class="anchor" href="#14-revised-versions-of-this-license">#</a> 14. Revised Versions of this License.</h3><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions<br>will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in<br>detail to address new problems or concerns.</p><p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program<br>specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public<br>License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of<br>following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or<br>of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the<br>Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public<br>License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free<br>Software Foundation.</p><p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions<br>of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public<br>statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to<br>choose that version for the Program.</p><p>Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>later version.</p><h3 id="15-disclaimer-of-warranty"><a class="anchor" href="#15-disclaimer-of-warranty">#</a> 15.
